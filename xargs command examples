1. The first example shows how to find out all the .png images and archive them using the tar utility as follows.

Here, the action command -print0 enables printing of the full file path on the standard output, followed by a null character and -0 xargs flag effectively deals with space in filenames.

$ find Pictures/tecmint/ -name "*.png" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 tar -cvzf images.tar.gz

2. You can also convert muti-line output from ls command into single line using xargs as follows.

$ ls -1 Pictures/tecmint/
$ ls -1 Pictures/tecmint/ | xargs

3. To generate a compact list of all Linux user accounts on the system, use the following command.

$ cut -d: -f1 < /etc/passwd | sort | xargs
Find List of Linux Users
Find List of Linux Users

4. Assuming you have a list of files, and you wish to know the number of lines/words/characters in each file in the list, you can use ls command and xargs for this purpose as follows.

$ ls *upload* | xargs wc
Count Number of Lines, Words and Characters in Files
Count Number of Lines, Words and Characters in Files

5. Xarags also allows you to find and recursively remove a directory, for example the following command will recursively remove DomTerm in the directory Downloads.

$ find Downloads -name "DomTerm" -type d -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -v -rf "{}"

6. Similarly to the previous command, you can also finds all files named net_stats in the current directory and delete them.

$ find . -name "net_stats" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 /bin/rm -v -rf "{}"
7. Next, use xargs to copy a file to multiple directories at once; in this example we are trying to copy the file.

$ echo ./Templates/ ./Documents/ | xargs -n 1 cp -v ./Downloads/SIC_Template.xlsx

8. You can also use the find command, xargs and rename commands together to to rename all files or subdirectories in a particular directory to lowercase as follows.

$ find Documnets -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -v 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;
9. Here is another useful usage example for xargs, it shows how to delete all files within a directory except one or few files with a given extension.

$ find . -type f -not -name '*gz' -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} rm -v {}
10. As mentioned earlier, you can instruct xargs to read items from a file instead of standard input using the -a flag as shown.

$ xargs -a rss_links.txt
11. You can enable verbosity using the -t flag, which tells xargs to print the command line on the standard error output before executing it.

$ find Downloads -name "DomTerm" -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -t /bin/rm -rf "{}"
12. By default, xargs terminates/delimits items using blank spaces, you can use the -d flag to set the delimiter which may be a single character, a C-style character escape such as \n, or an octal or hexadecimal escape code.

In addition, you can also prompt the user about whether to run each command line and read a line from the terminal, using the -p flag as shown (simply type y for yes or n for no).

$ echo ./Templates/ ./Documents/ | xargs -p -n 1 cp -v ./Downloads/SIC_Template.xlsx
